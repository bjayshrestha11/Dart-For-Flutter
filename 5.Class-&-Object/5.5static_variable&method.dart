 * Static variables are also known as class variables
 * Static Methods are also known as class Methods
 * 
 * Static variables are lazily initialized
 * - they are not initialized until they are used in Program
 * - They consume memory only when they are used
 * 
 * Static methods has nothing to do with class object or instance
 * - cannot use 'this' keyword within Static method
 * 
 * From a Static Method
